I think we might be able to use folders in XNA if we then create the class inside the folder. Lets try this out when we are together sometime.

NEW STORY IDEA-
game title: difficult choices
set in apocalyptic future. Player has to make brutal choices like kill wanderers and upset citizens, let them starve and have them come back as an angry mob and attack the player, or feed them and suffer crippling consequences that make them loose the game. The player would receive reports of how his actions affected his people. Another choice could be choosing between letting workers starve or letting soldiers starve. Another would be investing in advanced military or feeding people. This idea is inspired by some of the stuff kim jong un said in The Interview. The core of the game is making brutally strategic decisions that a leader has to make. There is no clear cut winning in this game. Eventually something kills the player and leaves them with a bunch of questions about if they made the right decisions.
